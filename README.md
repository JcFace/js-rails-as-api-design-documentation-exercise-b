# API Design Exercise - B

## Part I - Backend API Documentation

In this repository, there is a Rails app. Your job is to explore that app (read
and run the code) and write documentation for one of the resources. You should
write your documentation in a markdown file.

Document the index endpoint of the Coffee resource. You should include
information on:

- how to access the resource
- how to filter by origin
- how to how to limit to some number of results
- how to specify which page of results

Once you've finished writing the documentation, send the markdown file to your
partner.

## Part II - Build a Frontend Feature

Your partner will send you a markdown file documenting an API. Using that
documentation, add the following feature to your frontend app.

- When the user types in the dog search bar and presses the search button, fetch
  the dogs that match the input and display the information about the dogs from
  the API
- When the user selects a different radio button for the ordering, fetch the
  dogs and display with the selected ordering
